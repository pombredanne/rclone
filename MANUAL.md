Install
-------

Rclone is a Go program and comes as a single binary file.

[Download](http://rclone.org/downloads/) the relevant binary.

Or alternatively if you have Go 1.5+ installed use

    go get github.com/ncw/rclone

and this will build the binary in `$GOPATH/bin`.  If you have built
rclone before then you will want to update its dependencies first with
this

    go get -u -v github.com/ncw/rclone/...

See the [Usage section](http://rclone.org/docs/) of the docs for how to use rclone, or
run `rclone -h`.

linux binary downloaded files install example
-------

    unzip rclone-v1.17-linux-amd64.zip
    cd rclone-v1.17-linux-amd64
    #copy binary file
    sudo cp rclone /usr/sbin/
    sudo chown root:root /usr/sbin/rclone
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/sbin/rclone
    #install manpage
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
    sudo cp rclone.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    sudo mandb 

Installation with Ansible
-------

This can be done with [Stefan Weichinger's ansible
role](https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone).

Instructions

  1. `git clone https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone.git` into your local roles-directory
  2. add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:
    
```
    - hosts: rclone-hosts
      roles:
          - rclone
```

Configure
---------

First you'll need to configure rclone.  As the object storage systems
have quite complicated authentication these are kept in a config file
`.rclone.conf` in your home directory by default.  (You can use the
`--config` option to choose a different config file.)

The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:

    rclone config

Usage
-----

Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.

Its syntax is like this

    Syntax: [options] subcommand <parameters> <parameters...>

Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, eg
"drive:myfolder" to look at "myfolder" in Google drive.

You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.

Subcommands
-----------

### rclone copy source:path dest:path ###

Copy the source to the destination.  Doesn't transfer
unchanged files, testing by size and modification time or
MD5SUM.  Doesn't delete files from the destination.

Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced,
not the directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the
contents of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and
contents.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

For example

    rclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath

Let's say there are two files in sourcepath

    sourcepath/one.txt
    sourcepath/two.txt

This copies them to

    destpath/one.txt
    destpath/two.txt

Not to

    destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
    destpath/sourcepath/two.txt

If you are familiar with `rsync`, rclone always works as if you had
written a trailing / - meaning "copy the contents of this directory".
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.

See the `--no-traverse` option for controlling whether rclone lists
the destination directory or not.

### rclone sync source:path dest:path ###

Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination
only.  Doesn't transfer unchanged files, testing by size and
modification time or MD5SUM.  Destination is updated to match
source, including deleting files if necessary.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` flag to see exactly what would be copied and deleted.

Note that files in the destination won't be deleted if there were any
errors at any point.

It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.  See
extended explanation in the `copy` command above if unsure.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

### move source:path dest:path ###

Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination
directory. Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap.

If no filters are in use and if possible this will server side move
`source:path` into `dest:path`. After this `source:path` will no
longer longer exist.

Otherwise for each file in `source:path` selected by the filters (if
any) this will move it into `dest:path`.  If possible a server side
move will be used, otherwise it will copy it (server side if possible)
into `dest:path` then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in
`source:path`.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
--dry-run flag.

### rclone ls remote:path ###

List all the objects in the path with size and path.

### rclone lsd remote:path ###

List all directories/containers/buckets in the the path.

### rclone lsl remote:path ###

List all the objects in the the path with modification time,
size and path.

### rclone md5sum remote:path ###

Produces an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.  This
is in the same format as the standard md5sum tool produces.

### rclone sha1sum remote:path ###

Produces an sha1sum file for all the objects in the path.  This
is in the same format as the standard sha1sum tool produces.

### rclone size remote:path ###

Prints the total size of objects in remote:path and the number of
objects.

### rclone mkdir remote:path ###

Make the path if it doesn't already exist

### rclone rmdir remote:path ###

Remove the path.  Note that you can't remove a path with
objects in it, use purge for that.

### rclone purge remote:path ###

Remove the path and all of its contents.  Note that this does not obey
include/exclude filters - everything will be removed.  Use `delete` if
you want to selectively delete files.

### rclone delete remote:path ###

Remove the contents of path.  Unlike `purge` it obeys include/exclude
filters so can be used to selectively delete files.

Eg delete all files bigger than 100MBytes

Check what would be deleted first (use either)

    rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
    rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path

Then delete

    rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path

That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MB", hence
delete all files bigger than 100MBytes.

### rclone check source:path dest:path ###

Checks the files in the source and destination match.  It
compares sizes and MD5SUMs and prints a report of files which
don't match.  It doesn't alter the source or destination.

`--size-only` may be used to only compare the sizes, not the MD5SUMs.

### rclone cleanup remote:path ###

Clean up the remote if possible.  Empty the trash or delete old file
versions. Not supported by all remotes.

### rclone dedupe remote:path ###

By default `dedup` interactively finds duplicate files and offers to
delete all but one or rename them to be different. Only useful with
Google Drive which can have duplicate file names.

The `dedupe` command will delete all but one of any identical (same
md5sum) files it finds without confirmation.  This means that for most
duplicated files the `dedupe` command will not be interactive.  You
can use `--dry-run` to see what would happen without doing anything.

Here is an example run.

Before - with duplicates

```
$ rclone lsl drive:dupes
  6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:16.798000000 one.txt
  6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:11.775000000 one.txt
   564374 2016-03-05 16:23:06.731000000 one.txt
  6048320 2016-03-05 16:18:26.092000000 one.txt
  6048320 2016-03-05 16:22:46.185000000 two.txt
  1744073 2016-03-05 16:22:38.104000000 two.txt
   564374 2016-03-05 16:22:52.118000000 two.txt
```

Now the `dedupe` session

```
$ rclone dedupe drive:dupes

Dedupe can be run non interactively using the `--dedupe-mode` flag.

  * `--dedupe-mode interactive` - interactive as above.
  * `--dedupe-mode skip` - removes identical files then skips anything left.
  * `--dedupe-mode first` - removes identical files then keeps the first one.
  * `--dedupe-mode newest` - removes identical files then keeps the newest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode oldest` - removes identical files then keeps the oldest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode rename` - removes identical files then renames the rest to be different.

For example to rename all the identically named photos in your Google Photos directory, do

    rclone dedupe --dedupe-mode rename "drive:Google Photos"

### rclone help ###

Copying single files
--------------------

rclone normally syncs or copies directories.  However if the source
remote points to a file, rclone will just copy that file.  The
destination remote must point to a directory - rclone will give the
error `Failed to create file system for "remote:file": is a file not a
directory` if it isn't.

For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called
`test.jpg`, then you could copy just that file like this

    rclone copy remote:test.jpg /tmp/download

The file `test.jpg` will be placed inside `/tmp/download`.

This is equivalent to specifying

    rclone copy --no-traverse --files-from /tmp/files remote: /tmp/download

Where `/tmp/files` contains the single line

    test.jpg

It is recommended to use `copy` when copying single files not `sync`.
They have pretty much the same effect but `copy` will use a lot less
memory.

Quoting and the shell
---------------------

When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell.  This interprets various characters in
an OS specific way.

Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell rules

### Linux / OSX ###

If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (eg `*`, `?`, `$`,
`'`, `"` etc) then you must quote them.  Use single quotes `'` by default.

    rclone copy 'Important files?' remote:backup

If you want to send a `'` you will need to use `"`, eg

    rclone copy "O'Reilly Reviews" remote:backup

The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want
the full details you'll have to consult the manual page for your
shell.

### Windows ###

If your names have spaces in you need to put them in `"`, eg

    rclone copy "E:\folder name\folder name\folder name" remote:backup

If you are using the root directory on its own then don't quote it
(see [#464](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/464) for why), eg

    rclone copy E:\ remote:backup

Server Side Copy
----------------

Drive, S3, Dropbox, Swift and Google Cloud Storage support server side
copy.

This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone won't
download all the files and re-upload them; it will instruct the server
to copy them in place.

Eg

    rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket

Will copy the contents of `oldbucket` to `newbucket` without
downloading and re-uploading.

Remotes which don't support server side copy (eg local) **will**
download and re-upload in this case.

Server side copies are used with `sync` and `copy` and will be
identified in the log when using the `-v` flag.

Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.

This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, eg

    rclone sync remote:current-backup remote:previous-backup
    rclone sync /path/to/files remote:current-backup

Options
-------

Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.

Options which use TIME use the go time parser.  A duration string is a
possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional
fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid
time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

Options which use SIZE use kByte by default.  However a suffix of `b`
for bytes, `k` for kBytes, `M` for MBytes and `G` for GBytes may be
used.  These are the binary units, eg 1, 2\*\*10, 2\*\*20, 2\*\*30
respectively.

### --bwlimit=SIZE ###

Bandwidth limit in kBytes/s, or use suffix b|k|M|G.  The default is `0`
which means to not limit bandwidth.

For example to limit bandwidth usage to 10 MBytes/s use `--bwlimit 10M`

This only limits the bandwidth of the data transfer, it doesn't limit
the bandwith of the directory listings etc.

### --checkers=N ###

The number of checkers to run in parallel.  Checkers do the equality
checking of files during a sync.  For some storage systems (eg s3,
swift, dropbox) this can take a significant amount of time so they are
run in parallel.

The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.

### -c, --checksum ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
the file hash and size to determine if files are equal.

This is useful when the remote doesn't support setting modified time
and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.

This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, eg Drive and Swift. For details of which
remotes support which hash type see the table in the [overview
section](http://rclone.org/overview/).

Eg `rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket` would run much
quicker than without the `--checksum` flag.

When using this flag, rclone won't update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.

### --config=CONFIG_FILE ###

Specify the location of the rclone config file.  Normally this is in
your home directory as a file called `.rclone.conf`.  If you run
`rclone -h` and look at the help for the `--config` option you will
see where the default location is for you.  Use this flag to override
the config location, eg `rclone --config=".myconfig" .config`.

### --contimeout=TIME ###

Set the connection timeout. This should be in go time format which
looks like `5s` for 5 seconds, `10m` for 10 minutes, or `3h30m`.

The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.  It is
`1m` by default.

### --dedupe-mode MODE ###

Mode to run dedupe command in.  One of `interactive`, `skip`, `first`, `newest`, `oldest`, `rename`.  The default is `interactive`.  See the dedupe command for more information as to what these options mean.

### -n, --dry-run ###

Do a trial run with no permanent changes.  Use this to see what rclone
would do without actually doing it.  Useful when setting up the `sync`
command which deletes files in the destination.

### --ignore-existing ###

Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files
that exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.

While this isn't a generally recommended option, it can be useful
in cases where your files change due to encryption. However, it cannot
correct partial transfers in case a transfer was interrupted.

### --ignore-size ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
only the modification time.  If `--checksum` is set then it only
checks the checksum.

It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same
after transfer.

This can be useful for transferring files to and from onedrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see
[#399](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/399) for more info).

### -I, --ignore-times ###

Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all
files regardless of the state of files on the destination.

Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same
modification time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if
using `--checksum`).

### --log-file=FILE ###

Log all of rclone's output to FILE.  This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in
combination with the `-v` flag.  See the Logging section for more
info.

### --low-level-retries NUMBER ###

This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.

A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation - typically one
HTTP request.  This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for
example.  You will see low level retries in the log with the `-v`
flag.

This shouldn't need to be changed from the default in normal
operations, however if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish
to reduce the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the
`--retries` flag) quicker.

Disable low level retries with `--low-level-retries 1`.

### --max-depth=N ###

This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.

So if you do `rclone --max-depth 1 ls remote:path` you will see only
the files in the top level directory.  Using `--max-depth 2` means you
will see all the files in first two directory levels and so on.

For historical reasons the `lsd` command defaults to using a
`--max-depth` of 1 - you can override this with the command line flag.

You can use this command to disable recursion (with `--max-depth 1`).

Note that if you use this with `sync` and `--delete-excluded` the
files not recursed through are considered excluded and will be deleted
on the destination.  Test first with `--dry-run` if you are not sure
what will happen.

### --modify-window=TIME ###

When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.

The default is `1ns` unless this is overridden by a remote.  For
example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
`1s` by default.

This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.

### --no-gzip-encoding ###

Don't set `Accept-Encoding: gzip`.  This means that rclone won't ask
the server for compressed files automatically. Useful if you've set
the server to return files with `Content-Encoding: gzip` but you
uploaded compressed files.

There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.

### --no-update-modtime ###

When using this flag, rclone won't update modification times of remote
files if they are incorrect as it would normally.

This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(eg the Google Drive client).

### -q, --quiet ###

Normally rclone outputs stats and a completion message.  If you set
this flag it will make as little output as possible.

### --retries int ###

Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).

Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries helps pick up the
files which didn't get transferred because of errors.

Disable retries with `--retries 1`.

### --size-only ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
only the size.

This can be useful transferring files from dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn't set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.

### --stats=TIME ###

Rclone will print stats at regular intervals to show its progress.

This sets the interval.

The default is `1m`. Use 0 to disable.

### --delete-(before,during,after) ###

This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.

Specifying the value `--delete-before` will delete all files present
on the destination, but not on the source *before* starting the
transfer of any new or updated files.  This uses extra memory as it
has to store the source listing before proceeding.

Specifying `--delete-during` (default value) will delete files while
checking and uploading files. This is usually the fastest option.
Currently this works the same as `--delete-after` but it may change in
the future.

Specifying `--delete-after` will delay deletion of files until all new/updated
files have been successfully transfered.

### --timeout=TIME ###

This sets the IO idle timeout.  If a transfer has started but then
becomes idle for this long it is considered broken and disconnected.

The default is `5m`.  Set to 0 to disable.

### --transfers=N ###

The number of file transfers to run in parallel.  It can sometimes be
useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote is giving a lot
of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and a fast remote.

The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.

### -u, --update ###

This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination
and have a modified time that is newer than the source file.

If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window precision) to the source file's, it will be
updated if the sizes are different.

On remotes which don't support mod time directly the time checked will
be the uploaded time.  This means that if uploading to one of these
remoes, rclone will skip any files which exist on the destination and
have an uploaded time that is newer than the modification time of the
source file.

This can be useful when transferring to a remote which doesn't support
mod times directly as it is more accurate than a `--size-only` check
and faster than using `--checksum`.

### -v, --verbose ###

If you set this flag, rclone will become very verbose telling you
about every file it considers and transfers.

Very useful for debugging.

### -V, --version ###

Prints the version number

Configuration Encryption
------------------------
Your configuration file contains information for logging in to 
your cloud services. This means that you should keep your 
`.rclone.conf` file in a secure location.

If you are in an environment where that isn't possible, you can
add a password to your configuration. This means that you will
have to enter the password every time you start rclone.

To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute `rclone config`.

```
>rclone config
Current remotes:

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/s/q>
```

Go into `s`, Set configuration password:
```
e/n/d/s/q> s
Your configuration is not encrypted.
If you add a password, you will protect your login information to cloud services.
a) Add Password
q) Quit to main menu
a/q> a
Enter NEW configuration password:
password:
Confirm NEW password:
password:
Password set
Your configuration is encrypted.
c) Change Password
u) Unencrypt configuration
q) Quit to main menu
c/u/q>
```

Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone
you will now be asked for the password. In the same menu you can 
change the password or completely remove encryption from your
configuration.

There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.

rclone uses [nacl secretbox](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) 
which in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate 
your configuration with secret-key cryptography.
The password is SHA-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox.
The hashed password is not stored.

While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing
your encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.

If it is safe in your environment, you can set the `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS`
environment variable to contain your password, in which case it will be
used for decrypting the configuration.

If you are running rclone inside a script, you might want to disable 
password prompts. To do that, pass the parameter 
`--ask-password=false` to rclone. This will make rclone fail instead
of asking for a password if `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` doesn't contain
a valid password.


Developer options
-----------------

These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.  There
are also some more remote specific options which aren't documented
here which are used for testing.  These start with remote name eg
`--drive-test-option` - see the docs for the remote in question.

### --cpuprofile=FILE ###

Write CPU profile to file.  This can be analysed with `go tool pprof`.

### --dump-bodies ###

Dump HTTP headers and bodies - may contain sensitive info.  Can be
very verbose.  Useful for debugging only.

### --dump-filters ###

Dump the filters to the output.  Useful to see exactly what include
and exclude options are filtering on.

### --dump-headers ###

Dump HTTP headers - may contain sensitive info.  Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.

### --memprofile=FILE ###

Write memory profile to file. This can be analysed with `go tool pprof`.

### --no-check-certificate=true/false ###

`--no-check-certificate` controls whether a client verifies the
server's certificate chain and host name.
If `--no-check-certificate` is true, TLS accepts any certificate
presented by the server and any host name in that certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

This option defaults to `false`.

**This should be used only for testing.**

### --no-traverse ###

The `--no-traverse` flag controls whether the destination file system
is traversed when using the `copy` or `move` commands.

If you are only copying a small number of files and/or have a large
number of files on the destination then `--no-traverse` will stop
rclone listing the destination and save time.

However if you are copying a large number of files, escpecially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files haven't changed and won't
need copying then you shouldn't use `--no-traverse`.

It can also be used to reduce the memory usage of rclone when copying
- `rclone --no-traverse copy src dst` won't load either the source or
destination listings into memory so will use the minimum amount of
memory.

Filtering
---------

For the filtering options

  * `--delete-excluded`
  * `--filter`
  * `--filter-from`
  * `--exclude`
  * `--exclude-from`
  * `--include`
  * `--include-from`
  * `--files-from`
  * `--min-size`
  * `--max-size`
  * `--min-age`
  * `--max-age`
  * `--dump-filters`

See the [filtering section](http://rclone.org/filtering/).

Logging
-------

rclone has 3 levels of logging, `Error`, `Info` and `Debug`.

By default rclone logs `Error` and `Info` to standard error and `Debug`
to standard output.  This means you can redirect standard output and
standard error to different places.

By default rclone will produce `Error` and `Info` level messages.

If you use the `-q` flag, rclone will only produce `Error` messages.

If you use the `-v` flag, rclone will produce `Error`, `Info` and
`Debug` messages.

If you use the `--log-file=FILE` option, rclone will redirect `Error`,
`Info` and `Debug` messages along with standard error to FILE.

Exit Code
---------

If any errors occurred during the command, rclone will set a non zero
exit code.  This allows scripts to detect when rclone operations have
failed.

# Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine #

Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an
Internet connected web browser.

If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (eg a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then
you will need to use an alternative means of configuration.  There are
two ways of doing it, described below.

## Configuring using rclone authorize ##

On the headless box

```
...
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has a web browser available.
Execute the following on your machine:
	rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
Then paste the result below:
result>
```

Then on your main desktop machine

```
rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Paste the following into your remote machine --->
SECRET_TOKEN
<---End paste
```

Then back to the headless box, paste in the code

```
result> SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
[acd12]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>
```

## Configuring by copying the config file ##

Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file.  This
can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.

So first configure rclone on your desktop machine

    rclone config

to set up the config file.

Find the config file by running `rclone -h` and looking for the help for the `--config` option

```
$ rclone -h
[snip]
      --config="/home/user/.rclone.conf": Config file.
[snip]
```

Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp etc) and
place it in the correct place (use `rclone -h` on the remote box to
find out where).

# Filtering, includes and excludes #

Rclone has a sophisticated set of include and exclude rules. Some of
these are based on patterns and some on other things like file size.

The filters are applied for the `copy`, `sync`, `move`, `ls`, `lsl`,
`md5sum`, `sha1sum`, `size`, `delete` and `check` operations.
Note that `purge` does not obey the filters.

Each path as it passes through rclone is matched against the include
and exclude rules like `--include`, `--exclude`, `--include-from`,
`--exclude-from`, `--filter`, or `--filter-from`. The simplest way to
try them out is using the `ls` command, or `--dry-run` together with
`-v`.

**Important** Due to limitations of the command line parser you can
only use any of these options once - if you duplicate them then rclone
will use the last one only.

## Patterns ##

The patterns used to match files for inclusion or exclusion are based
on "file globs" as used by the unix shell.

If the pattern starts with a `/` then it only matches at the top level
of the directory tree, relative to the root of the remote.
If it doesn't start with `/` then it is matched starting at the
**end of the path**, but it will only match a complete path element:

    file.jpg  - matches "file.jpg"
              - matches "directory/file.jpg"
              - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
              - doesn't match "directory/afile.jpg"
    /file.jpg - matches "file.jpg" in the root directory of the remote
              - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
              - doesn't match "directory/file.jpg"

**Important** Note that you must use `/` in patterns and not `\` even
if running on Windows.

A `*` matches anything but not a `/`.

    *.jpg  - matches "file.jpg"
           - matches "directory/file.jpg"
           - doesn't match "file.jpg/something"

Use `**` to match anything, including slashes (`/`).

    dir/** - matches "dir/file.jpg"
           - matches "dir/dir1/dir2/file.jpg"
           - doesn't match "directory/file.jpg"
           - doesn't match "adir/file.jpg"

A `?` matches any character except a slash `/`.

    l?ss  - matches "less"
          - matches "lass"
          - doesn't match "floss"

A `[` and `]` together make a a character class, such as `[a-z]` or
`[aeiou]` or `[[:alpha:]]`.  See the [go regexp
docs](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/) for more info on these.

    h[ae]llo - matches "hello"
             - matches "hallo"
             - doesn't match "hullo"

A `{` and `}` define a choice between elements.  It should contain a
comma seperated list of patterns, any of which might match.  These
patterns can contain wildcards.

    {one,two}_potato - matches "one_potato"
                     - matches "two_potato"
                     - doesn't match "three_potato"
                     - doesn't match "_potato"

Special characters can be escaped with a `\` before them.

    \*.jpg       - matches "*.jpg"
    \\.jpg       - matches "\.jpg"
    \[one\].jpg  - matches "[one].jpg"

Note also that rclone filter globs can only be used in one of the
filter command line flags, not in the specification of the remote, so
`rclone copy "remote:dir*.jpg" /path/to/dir` won't work - what is
required is `rclone --include "*.jpg" copy remote:dir /path/to/dir`

### Directories ###

Rclone keeps track of directories that could match any file patterns.

Eg if you add the include rule

    \a\*.jpg

Rclone will synthesize the directory include rule

    \a\

If you put any rules which end in `\` then it will only match
directories.

Directory matches are **only** used to optimise directory access
patterns - you must still match the files that you want to match.
Directory matches won't optimise anything on bucket based remotes (eg
s3, swift, google compute storage, b2) which don't have a concept of
directory.

### Differences between rsync and rclone patterns ###

Rclone implements bash style `{a,b,c}` glob matching which rsync doesn't.

Rclone always does a wildcard match so `\` must always escape a `\`.

## How the rules are used ##

Rclone maintains a list of include rules and exclude rules.

Each file is matched in order against the list until it finds a match.
The file is then included or excluded according to the rule type.

If the matcher falls off the bottom of the list then the path is
included.

For example given the following rules, `+` being include, `-` being
exclude,

    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    - *

This would include

  * `file1.jpg`
  * `file3.png`
  * `file2.avi`

This would exclude

  * `secret17.jpg`
  * non `*.jpg` and `*.png`

A similar process is done on directory entries before recursing into
them.  This only works on remotes which have a concept of directory
(Eg local, google drive, onedrive, amazon drive) and not on bucket
based remotes (eg s3, swift, google compute storage, b2).

## Adding filtering rules ##

Filtering rules are added with the following command line flags.

### `--exclude` - Exclude files matching pattern ###

Add a single exclude rule with `--exclude`.

Eg `--exclude *.bak` to exclude all bak files from the sync.

### `--exclude-from` - Read exclude patterns from file ###

Add exclude rules from a file.

Prepare a file like this `exclude-file.txt`

    # a sample exclude rule file
    *.bak
    file2.jpg

Then use as `--exclude-from exclude-file.txt`.  This will sync all
files except those ending in `bak` and `file2.jpg`.

This is useful if you have a lot of rules.

### `--include` - Include files matching pattern ###

Add a single include rule with `--include`.

Eg `--include *.{png,jpg}` to include all `png` and `jpg` files in the
backup and no others.

This adds an implicit `--exclude *` at the very end of the filter
list. This means you can mix `--include` and `--include-from` with the
other filters (eg `--exclude`) but you must include all the files you
want in the include statement.  If this doesn't provide enough
flexibility then you must use `--filter-from`.

### `--include-from` - Read include patterns from file ###

Add include rules from a file.

Prepare a file like this `include-file.txt`

    # a sample include rule file
    *.jpg
    *.png
    file2.avi

Then use as `--include-from include-file.txt`.  This will sync all
`jpg`, `png` files and `file2.avi`.

This is useful if you have a lot of rules.

This adds an implicit `--exclude *` at the very end of the filter
list. This means you can mix `--include` and `--include-from` with the
other filters (eg `--exclude`) but you must include all the files you
want in the include statement.  If this doesn't provide enough
flexibility then you must use `--filter-from`.

### `--filter` - Add a file-filtering rule ###

This can be used to add a single include or exclude rule.  Include
rules start with `+ ` and exclude rules start with `- `.  A special
rule called `!` can be used to clear the existing rules.

Eg `--filter "- *.bak"` to exclude all bak files from the sync.

### `--filter-from` - Read filtering patterns from a file ###

Add include/exclude rules from a file.

Prepare a file like this `filter-file.txt`

    # a sample exclude rule file
    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    # exclude everything else
    - *

Then use as `--filter-from filter-file.txt`.  The rules are processed
in the order that they are defined.

This example will include all `jpg` and `png` files, exclude any files
matching `secret*.jpg` and include `file2.avi`.  Everything else will
be excluded from the sync.

### `--files-from` - Read list of source-file names ###

This reads a list of file names from the file passed in and **only**
these files are transferred.  The filtering rules are ignored
completely if you use this option.

Prepare a file like this `files-from.txt`

    # comment
    file1.jpg
    file2.jpg

Then use as `--files-from files-from.txt`.  This will only transfer
`file1.jpg` and `file2.jpg` providing they exist.

For example, let's say you had a few files you want to back up
regularly with these absolute paths:

    /home/user1/important
    /home/user1/dir/file
    /home/user2/stuff

To copy these you'd find a common subdirectory - in this case `/home`
and put the remaining files in `files-from.txt` with or without
leading `/`, eg

    user1/important
    user1/dir/file
    user2/stuff

You could then copy these to a remote like this

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home remote:backup

The 3 files will arrive in `remote:backup` with the paths as in the
`files-from.txt`.

You could of course choose `/` as the root too in which case your
`files-from.txt` might look like this.

    /home/user1/important
    /home/user1/dir/file
    /home/user2/stuff

And you would transfer it like this

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt / remote:backup

In this case there will be an extra `home` directory on the remote.

### `--min-size` - Don't transfer any file smaller than this ###

This option controls the minimum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to `kBytes` but a suffix of `k`, `M`, or `G` can be
used.

For example `--min-size 50k` means no files smaller than 50kByte will be
transferred.

### `--max-size` - Don't transfer any file larger than this ###

This option controls the maximum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to `kBytes` but a suffix of `k`, `M`, or `G` can be
used.

For example `--max-size 1G` means no files larger than 1GByte will be
transferred.

### `--max-age` - Don't transfer any file older than this ###

This option controls the maximum age of files to transfer.  Give in
seconds or with a suffix of:

  * `ms` - Milliseconds
  * `s` - Seconds
  * `m` - Minutes
  * `h` - Hours
  * `d` - Days
  * `w` - Weeks
  * `M` - Months
  * `y` - Years

For example `--max-age 2d` means no files older than 2 days will be
transferred.

### `--min-age` - Don't transfer any file younger than this ###

This option controls the minimum age of files to transfer.  Give in
seconds or with a suffix (see `--max-age` for list of suffixes)

For example `--min-age 2d` means no files younger than 2 days will be
transferred.

### `--delete-excluded` - Delete files on dest excluded from sync ###

**Important** this flag is dangerous - use with `--dry-run` and `-v` first.

When doing `rclone sync` this will delete any files which are excluded
from the sync on the destination.

If for example you did a sync from `A` to `B` without the `--min-size 50k` flag

    rclone sync A: B:

Then you repeated it like this with the `--delete-excluded`

    rclone --min-size 50k --delete-excluded sync A: B:

This would delete all files on `B` which are less than 50 kBytes as
these are now excluded from the sync.

Always test first with `--dry-run` and `-v` before using this flag.

### `--dump-filters` - dump the filters to the output ###

This dumps the defined filters to the output as regular expressions.

Useful for debugging.

## Quoting shell metacharacters ##

The examples above may not work verbatim in your shell as they have
shell metacharacters in them (eg `*`), and may require quoting.

Eg linux, OSX

  * `--include \*.jpg`
  * `--include '*.jpg'`
  * `--include='*.jpg'`

In Windows the expansion is done by the command not the shell so this
should work fine

  * `--include *.jpg`

# Overview of cloud storage systems #

Each cloud storage system is slighly different.  Rclone attempts to
provide a unified interface to them, but some underlying differences
show through.

## Features ##

Here is an overview of the major features of each cloud storage system.

| Name                   | Hash    | ModTime | Case Insensitive | Duplicate Files |
| ---------------------- |:-------:|:-------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| Google Drive           | MD5     | Yes     | No               | Yes             |
| Amazon S3              | MD5     | Yes     | No               | No              |
| Openstack Swift        | MD5     | Yes     | No               | No              |
| Dropbox                | -       | No      | Yes              | No              |
| Google Cloud Storage   | MD5     | Yes     | No               | No              |
| Amazon Drive           | MD5     | No      | Yes              | No              |
| Microsoft One Drive    | SHA1    | Yes     | Yes              | No              |
| Hubic                  | MD5     | Yes     | No               | No              |
| Backblaze B2           | SHA1    | Yes     | No               | No              |
| Yandex Disk            | MD5     | Yes     | No               | No              |
| The local filesystem   | All     | Yes     | Depends          | No              |

### Hash ###

The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects.  
The hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and
can be specifically used with the `--checksum` flag in syncs and in
the `check` command.

To use the checksum checks between filesystems they must support a 
common hash type.

### ModTime ###

The cloud storage system supports setting modification times on
objects.  If it does then this enables a using the modification times
as part of the sync.  If not then only the size will be checked by
default, though the MD5SUM can be checked with the `--checksum` flag.

All cloud storage systems support some kind of date on the object and
these will be set when transferring from the cloud storage system.

### Case Insensitive ###

If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to
have two files which differ only in case, eg `file.txt` and
`FILE.txt`.  If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that
isn't possible.

This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive
system and a case sensitive system.  The symptom of this is that no
matter how many times you run the sync it never completes fully.

The local filesystem may or may not be case sensitive depending on OS.

  * Windows - usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
  * OSX - usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case sensitive
  * Linux - usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file systems (eg FAT formatted USB keys)

Most of the time this doesn't cause any problems as people tend to
avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive
systems.

### Duplicate files ###

If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.

This confuses rclone greatly when syncing - use the `rclone dedupe`
command to rename or remove duplicates.

Google Drive
-----------------------------------------

Paths are specified as `drive:path`

Drive paths may be as deep as required, eg `drive:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
q) Quit config
e/n/d/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Amazon Drive
   \ "amazon cloud drive"
 2 / Amazon S3 (also Dreamhost, Ceph)
   \ "s3"
 3 / Backblaze B2
   \ "b2"
 4 / Dropbox
   \ "dropbox"
 5 / Google Cloud Storage (this is not Google Drive)
   \ "google cloud storage"
 6 / Google Drive
   \ "drive"
 7 / Hubic
   \ "hubic"
 8 / Local Disk
   \ "local"
 9 / Microsoft OneDrive
   \ "onedrive"
10 / Openstack Swift (Rackspace Cloud Files, Memset Memstore, OVH)
   \ "swift"
11 / Yandex Disk
   \ "yandex"
Storage> 6
Google Application Client Id - leave blank normally.
client_id> 
Google Application Client Secret - leave blank normally.
client_secret> 
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine or Y didn't work
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
--------------------
[remote]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = {"AccessToken":"xxxx.x.xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","RefreshToken":"1/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","Expiry":"2014-03-16T13:57:58.955387075Z","Extra":null}
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this
it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time ###

Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.

### Revisions ###

Google drive stores revisions of files.  When you upload a change to
an existing file to google drive using rclone it will create a new
revision of that file.

Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing
was

  * They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).
  * They do not count towards a user storage quota.

### Deleting files ###

By default rclone will delete files permanently when requested.  If
sending them to the trash is required instead then use the
`--drive-use-trash` flag.

### Specific options ###

Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage
system.

#### --drive-chunk-size=SIZE ####

Upload chunk size. Must a power of 2 >= 256k. Default value is 8 MB.

Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk
is buffered in memory one per transfer.

Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.

#### --drive-full-list ####

No longer does anything - kept for backwards compatibility.

#### --drive-upload-cutoff=SIZE ####

File size cutoff for switching to chunked upload.  Default is 8 MB.

#### --drive-use-trash ####

Send files to the trash instead of deleting permanently. Defaults to
off, namely deleting files permanently.

#### --drive-auth-owner-only ####

Only consider files owned by the authenticated user. Requires
that --drive-full-list=true (default).

#### --drive-formats ####

Google documents can only be exported from Google drive.  When rclone
downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download depending upon
this setting.

By default the formats are `docx,xlsx,pptx,svg` which are a sensible
default for an editable document.

When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order
and chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the
list. If the file can't be exported to a format on the formats list,
then rclone will choose a format from the default list.

If you prefer an archive copy then you might use `--drive-formats
pdf`, or if you prefer openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use
`--drive-formats ods,odt`.

Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is
calles `My Spreadsheet` on google docs, it will be exported as `My
Spreadsheet.xlsx` or `My Spreadsheet.pdf` etc.

Here are the possible extensions with their corresponding mime types.

| Extension | Mime Type | Description |
| --------- |-----------| ------------|
| csv  | text/csv | Standard CSV format for Spreadsheets |
| doc  | application/msword | Micosoft Office Document |

| xlsx | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet | Microsoft Office Spreadsheet |
| zip  | application/zip | A ZIP file of HTML, Images CSS |

### Limitations ###

Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting.  This causes rclone to be
limited to transferring about 2 files per second only.  Individual
files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MBytes/s but lots of
small files can take a long time.

Amazon S3
---------------------------------------

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, eg `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

Here is an example of making an s3 configuration.  First run

endpoint = 
location_constraint = 
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:bucket

### Modified time ###

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Amz-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1 ns.

### Multipart uploads ###

rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5GB. Note that files uploaded with multipart
upload don't have an MD5SUM.

### Buckets and Regions ###

With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (`rclone lsd`) using any region,
but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region it was
created in.  If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region,
you will get an error, `incorrect region, the bucket is not in 'XXX'
region`.

### Authentication ###
There are two ways to supply `rclone` with a set of AWS
credentials. In order of precedence:

 - Directly in the rclone configuration file (as configured by `rclone config`)
   - set `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`
 - Runtime configuration:
   - set `env_auth` to `true` in the config file
   - Exporting the following environment variables before running `rclone`
     - Access Key ID: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
     - Secret Access Key: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
   - Running `rclone` on an EC2 instance with an IAM role

If none of these option actually end up providing `rclone` with AWS
credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see below).

### Anonymous access to public buckets ###

If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.  Eg

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
q) Quit config
n/q> n
name> anons3
What type of source is it?
Choose a number from below
 1) amazon cloud drive
 2) b2
 3) drive
 4) dropbox
 5) google cloud storage
 6) swift
 7) hubic
 8) local
 9) onedrive
10) s3
11) yandex
type> 10
Get AWS credentials from runtime (environment variables or EC2 meta data if no env vars). Only applies if access_key_id and secret_access_key is blank.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 * Enter AWS credentials in the next step
 1) false
 * Get AWS credentials from the environment (env vars or IAM)
 2) true
env_auth> 1
AWS Access Key ID - leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.
access_key_id>
AWS Secret Access Key (password) - leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.
secret_access_key>
...
```

Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, eg

    rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes

You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.

### Ceph ###

Ceph is an object storage system which presents an Amazon S3 interface.

To use rclone with ceph, you need to set the following parameters in
the config.

```
access_key_id = Whatever
secret_access_key = Whatever
endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.goes.here/
region = other-v2-signature
```

Note also that Ceph sometimes puts `/` in the passwords it gives
users.  If you read the secret access key using the command line tools
you will get a JSON blob with the `/` escaped as `\/`.  Make sure you
only write `/` in the secret access key.

Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).

```
{
    "user_id": "xxx",
    "display_name": "xxxx",
    "keys": [
        {
            "user": "xxx",
            "access_key": "xxxxxx",
            "secret_key": "xxxxxx\/xxxx"
        }
    ],
}
```

Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the `/` as `\/`, so if you
use the secret key as `xxxxxx/xxxx`  it will work fine.

### Minio ###

[Minio](https://minio.io/) is an object storage server built for cloud application developers and devops.

It is very easy to install and provides an S3 compatible server which can be used by rclone.

To use it, install Minio following the instructions from the web site.

When it configures itself Minio will print something like this

```
AccessKey: WLGDGYAQYIGI833EV05A  SecretKey: BYvgJM101sHngl2uzjXS/OBF/aMxAN06JrJ3qJlF Region: us-east-1

Minio Object Storage:
     http://127.0.0.1:9000
     http://10.0.0.3:9000

Minio Browser:
     http://127.0.0.1:9000
     http://10.0.0.3:9000
```

These details need to go into `rclone config` like this.  Note that it
is important to put the region in as stated above.

```
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> WLGDGYAQYIGI833EV05A
secret_access_key> BYvgJM101sHngl2uzjXS/OBF/aMxAN06JrJ3qJlF   
region> us-east-1
endpoint> http://10.0.0.3:9000
location_constraint> 
server_side_encryption>
```

Which makes the config file look like this

```
[minio]
env_auth = false
access_key_id = WLGDGYAQYIGI833EV05A
secret_access_key = BYvgJM101sHngl2uzjXS/OBF/aMxAN06JrJ3qJlF
region = us-east-1
endpoint = http://10.0.0.3:9000
location_constraint = 
server_side_encryption = 
```

Minio doesn't support all the features of S3 yet.  In particular it
doesn't support MD5 checksums (ETags) or metadata.  This means rclone
can't check MD5SUMs or store the modified date.  However you can work
around this with the `--size-only` flag of rclone.

So once set up, for example to copy files into a bucket

    rclone --size-only copy /path/to/files minio:bucket

Swift
----------------------------------------

Swift refers to [Openstack Object Storage](http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-storage/).
Commercial implementations of that being:

  * [Rackspace Cloud Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/)
  * [Memset Memstore](http://www.memset.com/cloud/storage/)

Paths are specified as `remote:container` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, eg `remote:container/path/to/dir`.

Here is an example of making a swift configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all containers

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new container

    rclone mkdir remote:container

List the contents of a container

    rclone ls remote:container

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote container, deleting any
excess files in the container.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:container

### Specific options ###

Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage
system.

#### --swift-chunk-size=SIZE ####

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.  The
default for this is 5GB which is its maximum value.
      
### Modified time ###

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Object-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1
ns.

This is a defacto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

### Limitations ###

The Swift API doesn't return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won't check or use the
MD5SUM for these.

### Troubleshooting ###

#### Rclone gives Failed to create file system for "remote:": Bad Request ####

Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a "Bad
Request" error rather than a more sensible error when the
authentication fails for Swift.

So this most likely means your username / password is wrong.  You can
investigate further with the `--dump-bodies` flag.

#### Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn't have storage storage url and auth token ####

This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.

Dropbox
---------------------------------

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Dropbox paths may be as deep as required, eg
`remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
q) Quit config
e/n/d/q> n

app_secret = 
token = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your dropbox

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your dropbox

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a dropbox directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and MD5SUMs ###

Dropbox doesn't provide the ability to set modification times in the
V1 public API, so rclone can't support modified time with Dropbox.

This may change in the future - see these issues for details:

  * [Dropbox V2 API](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/349)
  * [Allow syncs for remotes that can't set modtime on existing objects](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/348)

Dropbox doesn't return any sort of checksum (MD5 or SHA1).

Together that means that syncs to dropbox will effectively have the
`--size-only` flag set.

### Specific options ###

Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage
system.

#### --dropbox-chunk-size=SIZE ####

Upload chunk size. Max 150M. The default is 128MB.  Note that this
isn't buffered into memory.

### Limitations ###

Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are some file names such as `thumbs.db` which Dropbox can't
store.  There is a full list of them in the ["Ignored Files" section
of this document](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145).  Rclone will
issue an error message `File name disallowed - not uploading` if it
attempt to upload one of those file names, but the sync won't fail.

If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then `rclone purge
dropbox:dir` will return the error `Failed to purge: There are too
many files involved in this operation`.  As a work-around do an
`rclone delete dropbix:dir` followed by an `rclone rmdir dropbox:dir`.

Google Cloud Storage
-------------------------------------------------

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, eg `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from Google Cloud Storage
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this
it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the buckets in your project

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:bucket

### Service Account support ###

You can set up rclone with Google Cloud Storage in an unattended mode,
i.e. not tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful
when you want to synchronise files onto machines that don't have
actively logged-in users, for example build machines.

To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform
[IAM Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts),
please head to the
[Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts)
section of the Google Developer Console. Service Accounts behave just
like normal `User` permissions in
[Google Cloud Storage ACLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control),
so you can limit their access (e.g. make them read only). After
creating an account, a JSON file containing the Service Account's
credentials will be downloaded onto your machines. These credentials
are what rclone will use for authentication.

To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path
to your Service Account credentials at the `service_account_file`
prompt and rclone won't use the browser based authentication
flow.

### Modified time ###

Google google cloud storage stores md5sums natively and rclone stores
modification times as metadata on the object, under the "mtime" key in
RFC3339 format accurate to 1ns.

Amazon Drive
-----------------------------------------

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, eg `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for Amazon Drive involves getting a token from
Amazon which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks
you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

```

See the [remote setup docs](http://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Amazon. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification
code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require
you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Amazon Drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Amazon Drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Amazon Drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and MD5SUMs ###

Amazon Drive doesn't allow modification times to be changed via
the API so these won't be accurate or used for syncing.

It does store MD5SUMs so for a more accurate sync, you can use the
`--checksum` flag.

### Deleting files ###

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.  Amazon
don't provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the
trash, so you will have to do that with one of Amazon's apps or via
the Amazon Drive website.

### Specific options ###

Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage
system.

#### --acd-templink-threshold=SIZE ####

Files this size or more will be downloaded via their `tempLink`. This
is to work around a problem with Amazon Drive which blocks downloads
of files bigger than about 10GB.  The default for this is 9GB which
shouldn't need to be changed.

To download files above this threshold, rclone requests a `tempLink`
which downloads the file through a temporary URL directly from the
underlying S3 storage.

### Limitations ###

Note that Amazon Drive is case insensitive so you can't have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

Amazon Drive has rate limiting so you may notice errors in the
sync (429 errors).  rclone will automatically retry the sync up to 3
times by default (see `--retries` flag) which should hopefully work
around this problem.

Amazon Drive has an internal limit of file sizes that can be uploaded
to the service. This limit is not officially published, but all files
larger than this will fail.

At the time of writing (Jan 2016) is in the area of 50GB per file.
This means that larger files are likely to fail.

Unfortunatly there is no way for rclone to see that this failure is 
because of file size, so it will retry the operation, as any other
failure. To avoid this problem, use `--max-size=50GB` option to limit
the maximum size of uploaded files.

Microsoft One Drive
-----------------------------------------

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, eg `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for One Drive involves getting a token from
Microsoft which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks
you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your One Drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an One Drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and hashes ###

One Drive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

One drive supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use `--checksum` flag.


### Deleting files ###

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.  Microsoft
doesn't provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the
trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft's apps or via
the One Drive website.

### Specific options ###

Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage
system.

#### --onedrive-chunk-size=SIZE ####

Above this size files will be chunked - must be multiple of 320k. The
default is 10MB.  Note that the chunks will be buffered into memory.

#### --onedrive-upload-cutoff=SIZE ####

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload - must be <= 100MB. The default
is 10MB.

### Limitations ###

Note that One Drive is case insensitive so you can't have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

Rclone only supports your default One Drive, and doesn't work with One
Drive for business.  Both these issues may be fixed at some point
depending on user demand!

There are quite a few characters that can't be in One Drive file
names.  These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows
platforms they are common.  Rclone will map these names to and from an
identical looking unicode equivalent.  For example if a file has a `?`
in it will be mapped to `？` instead.

Hubic
-----------------------------------------

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths are specified as `remote:container` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, eg `remote:container/path/to/dir`.

The initial setup for Hubic involves getting a token from Hubic which
you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List containers in the top level of your Hubic

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Hubic

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Hubic directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

If you want the directory to be visible in the official *Hubic
browser*, you need to copy your files to the `default` directory

    rclone copy /home/source remote:default/backup

### Modified time ###

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Object-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1
ns.

This is a defacto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

Note that Hubic wraps the Swift backend, so most of the properties of
are the same.

### Limitations ###

This uses the normal OpenStack Swift mechanism to refresh the Swift
API credentials and ignores the expires field returned by the Hubic
API.

The Swift API doesn't return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won't check or use the
MD5SUM for these.

Backblaze B2
----------------------------------------

B2 is [Backblaze's cloud storage system](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/).

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, eg `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

Here is an example of making a b2 configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.  You will
need your account number (a short hex number) and key (a long hex
number) which you can get from the b2 control panel.

```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any
excess files in the bucket.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:bucket

### Modified time ###

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Bz-Info-src_last_modified_millis` as milliseconds since 1970-01-01
in the Backblaze standard.  Other tools should be able to use this as
a modified time.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported except in
the case of updating a modification time on an existing object.  In
this case the object will be uploaded again as B2 doesn't have an API
method to set the modification time independent of doing an upload.

### SHA1 checksums ###

The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and
will be used in the syncing process.

Large files which are uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the
object as `X-Bz-Info-large_file_sha1` as recommended by Backblaze.

### Transfers ###

Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for
maximum speed.  In tests from my SSD equiped laptop the optimum
setting is about `--transfers 32` though higher numbers may be used
for a slight speed improvement. The optimum number for you may vary
depending on your hardware, how big the files are, how much you want
to load your computer, etc.  The default of `--transfers 4` is
definitely too low for Backblaze B2 though.

Note that uploading big files (bigger than 200 MB by default) will use
a 96 MB RAM buffer by default.  There can be at most `--transfers` of
these in use at any moment, so this sets the upper limit on the memory
used.

### Versions ###

When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a [new version
of it](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/file_versions.html).
Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will still be
available.

Old versions of files are visible using the `--b2-versions` flag.

If you wish to remove all the old versions then you can use the
`rclone cleanup remote:bucket` command which will delete all the old
versions of files, leaving the current ones intact.  You can also
supply a path and only old versions under that path will be deleted,
eg `rclone cleanup remote:bucket/path/to/stuff`.

When you `purge` a bucket, the current and the old versions will be
deleted then the bucket will be deleted.

However `delete` will cause the current versions of the files to
become hidden old versions.

Here is a session showing the listing and and retreival of an old
version followed by a `cleanup` of the old versions.

Show current version and all the versions with `--b2-versions` flag.

```
$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
        8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
       16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
       15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt
```

Retreive an old verson

```
$ rclone -q --b2-versions copy b2:cleanup-test/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt /tmp

$ ls -l /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ncw ncw 16 Jul  2 17:46 /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
```

Clean up all the old versions and show that they've gone.

```
$ rclone -q cleanup b2:cleanup-test

$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
```

### Specific options ###

Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage
system.

#### --b2-chunk-size valuee=SIZE ####

When uploading large files chunk the file into this size.  Note that
these chunks are buffered in memory and there might a maximum of
`--transfers` chunks in progress at once.  100,000,000 Bytes is the
minimim size (default 96M).

#### --b2-upload-cutoff=SIZE ####

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload (default 190.735 MiB == 200
MB). Files above this size will be uploaded in chunks of
`--b2-chunk-size`.

This value should be set no larger than 4.657GiB (== 5GB) as this is
the largest file size that can be uploaded.


#### --b2-test-mode=FLAG ####

This is for debugging purposes only.

Setting FLAG to one of the strings below will cause b2 to return
specific errors for debugging purposes.

  * `fail_some_uploads`
  * `expire_some_account_authorization_tokens`
  * `force_cap_exceeded`

These will be set in the `X-Bz-Test-Mode` header which is documented
in the [b2 integrations
checklist](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/integration_checklist.html).

#### --b2-versions ####

When set rclone will show and act on older versions of files.  For example

Listing without `--b2-versions`

```
$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
```

And with

```
$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
        8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
       16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
       15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt
```

Showing that the current version is unchanged but older versions can
be seen.  These have the UTC date that they were uploaded to the
server to the nearest millisecond appended to them.

Note that when using `--b2-versions` no file write operations are
permitted, so you can't upload files or delete them.

Yandex Disk
----------------------------------------

[Yandex Disk](https://disk.yandex.com) is a cloud storage solution created by [Yandex](http://yandex.com).

Yandex paths may be as deep as required, eg `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

Here is an example of making a yandex configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](http://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Yandex Disk. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:directory

### Modified time ###

Modified times are supported and are stored accurate to 1 ns in custom
metadata called `rclone_modified` in RFC3339 with nanoseconds format.

### MD5 checksums ###

MD5 checksums are natively supported by Yandex Disk.

Local Filesystem
-------------------------------------------

Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, eg `/path/to/wherever`, so

    rclone sync /home/source /tmp/destination

Will sync `/home/source` to `/tmp/destination`

These can be configured into the config file for consistencies sake,
but it is probably easier not to.

### Modified time ###

Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined by
the OS.  Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second
on OS X.

### Filenames ###

Filenames are expected to be encoded in UTF-8 on disk.  This is the
normal case for Windows and OS X.

There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF-8 encoded files names. If you are using an
old Linux filesystem with non UTF-8 file names (eg latin1) then you
can use the `convmv` tool to convert the filesystem to UTF-8. This
tool is available in most distributions' package managers.

If an invalid (non-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid caracters will
be replaced with the unicode replacement character, '�'.  `rclone`
will emit a debug message in this case (use `-v` to see), eg

```
Local file system at .: Replacing invalid UTF-8 characters in "gro\xdf"
```

### Long paths on Windows ###

Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to long
[UNC paths](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx#maxpath)
which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.

This is why you will see that your paths, for instance `c:\files` is
converted to the UNC path `\\?\c:\files` in the output,
and `\\server\share` is converted to `\\?\UNC\server\share`.

However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file
system drivers like [EncFS](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/261).
To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your `.rclone.conf` file:

```
[local]
nounc = true
```

If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate entry like this:

```
[nounc]
type = local
nounc = true
```
And use rclone like this:

`rclone copy c:\src nounc:z:\dst`

This will use UNC paths on `c:\src` but not on `z:\dst`.
Of course this will cause problems if the absolute path length of a
file exceeds 258 characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.

Bugs and Limitations
--------------------

### Empty directories are left behind / not created ##

With remotes that have a concept of directory, eg Local and Drive,
empty directories may be left behind, or not created when one was
expected.

This is because rclone doesn't have a concept of a directory - it only
works on objects.  Most of the object storage systems can't actually
store a directory so there is nowhere for rclone to store anything
about directories.

You can work round this to some extent with the`purge` command which
will delete everything under the path, **inluding** empty directories.

This may be fixed at some point in
[Issue #100](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/100)

### Directory timestamps aren't preserved ##

For the same reason as the above, rclone doesn't have a concept of a
directory - it only works on objects, therefore it can't preserve the
timestamps of directories.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands ###

Yes they do.  All the rclone commands (eg `sync`, `copy` etc) will
work on all the remote storage systems.

### Can I copy the config from one machine to another ###

Sure!  Rclone stores all of its config in a single file.  If you want
to find this file, the simplest way is to run `rclone -h` and look at
the help for the `--config` flag which will tell you where it is.

See the [remote setup docs](http://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for more info.

### How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no browser? ###

This has now been documented in its own [remote setup page](http://rclone.org/remote_setup/).

### Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3 ###

Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.

Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so
the node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.

The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).

Eg

    rclone sync drive:Folder s3:bucket


### Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time ###

You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, eg

```
Server A> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA
Server B> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB
```

If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two rclones may delete each others files, eg

```
Server A> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
Server B> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
```

The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be
different in this case, otherwise some file systems (eg Drive) may
make duplicates.

### Why doesn't rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like rsync? ###

Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system.  This means that you can see the files you
upload as expected using alternative access methods (eg using the
Google Drive web interface).  There is a 1:1 mapping between files on
your hard disk and objects created in the cloud storage system.

Cloud storage systems (at least none I've come across yet) don't
support partially uploading an object. You can't take an existing
object, and change some bytes in the middle of it.

It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the
1:1 mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.

All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work.  However to make
this work efficiently this would require storing a significant amount
of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of files to objects.

### Can rclone do bi-directional sync? ###

No, not at present.  rclone only does uni-directional sync from A ->
B. It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives - it
just requires writing the algorithm to do it.

### Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy? ###

Yes. rclone will use the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`,
`HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`, similar to cURL and other programs.

`HTTPS_PROXY` takes precedence over `HTTP_PROXY` for https requests.

The environment values may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]",
in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.

The `NO_PROXY` allows you to disable the proxy for specific hosts.
Hosts must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts.
For instance "foo.com" also matches "bar.foo.com".

### Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided error ###

This means that `rclone` can't file the SSL root certificates.  Likely
you are running `rclone` on a NAS with a cut-down Linux OS, or
possibly on Solaris.

Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.

    "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt", // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.
    "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt",   // Fedora/RHEL
    "/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem",             // OpenSUSE
    "/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem",            // OpenELEC

So doing something like this should fix the problem.  It also sets the
time which is important for SSL to work properly.

```
mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs/
curl -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org
```

Note that you may need to add the `--insecure` option to the `curl` command line if it doesn't work without.

```
curl --insecure -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
```

### Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented error ###

Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.

See the [system requirements section in the go install
docs](https://golang.org/doc/install) for full details.

### All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip ###

This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn't got the Microsoft Office suite installed.  The easiest way to
fix is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft Office
Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later
versions' file formats
