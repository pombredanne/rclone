Install
-------

Rclone is a Go program and comes as a single binary file.

[Download](/downloads/) the relevant binary.

Or alternatively if you have Go 1.5+ installed use

    go get github.com/ncw/rclone

and this will build the binary in `$GOPATH/bin`.  If you have built
rclone before then you will want to update its dependencies first with
this

    go get -u -v github.com/ncw/rclone/...

See the [Usage section](/docs/) of the docs for how to use rclone, or
run `rclone -h`.
